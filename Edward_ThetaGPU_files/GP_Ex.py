# # GPyTorch Regression Tutorial
# 
# ## Introduction
# 
# In this notebook, we demonstrate many of the design features of GPyTorch using the simplest example, training an RBF kernel Gaussian process on a simple function. We'll be modeling the function
# 
# \begin{align}
# y &= \sin(2\pi x) + \epsilon \\
#   \epsilon &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.04) 
# \end{align}
# 
# with 100 training examples, and testing on 51 test examples.
# 
# **Note:** this notebook is not necessarily intended to teach the mathematical background of Gaussian processes, but rather how to train a simple one and make predictions in GPyTorch. For a mathematical treatment, Chapter 2 of Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning provides a very thorough introduction to GP regression (this entire text is highly recommended): http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW2.pdf

# ### Set up training data
# 
# In the next cell, we set up the training data for this example. We'll be using 100 regularly spaced points on [0,1] which we evaluate the function on and add Gaussian noise to get the training labels.

# In[3]:


# Training data is 100 points in [0,1] inclusive regularly spaced
train_x = torch.linspace(0, 1, 100)
# True function is sin(2*pi*x) with Gaussian noise
train_y = torch.sin(train_x * (2 * math.pi)) + torch.randn(train_x.size()) * math.sqrt(0.04)


# ## Setting up the model
# 
# The next cell demonstrates the most critical features of a user-defined Gaussian process model in GPyTorch. Building a GP model in GPyTorch is different in a number of ways.
# 
# First in contrast to many existing GP packages, we do not provide full GP models for the user. Rather, we provide *the tools necessary to quickly construct one*. This is because we believe, analogous to building a neural network in standard PyTorch, it is important to have the flexibility to include whatever components are necessary. As can be seen in more complicated examples, this allows the user great flexibility in designing custom models.
# 
# For most GP regression models, you will need to construct the following GPyTorch objects:
# 
# 1. A **GP Model** (`gpytorch.models.ExactGP`) -  This handles most of the inference.
# 1. A **Likelihood** (`gpytorch.likelihoods.GaussianLikelihood`) - This is the most common likelihood used for GP regression.
# 1. A **Mean** - This defines the prior mean of the GP.(If you don't know which mean to use, a `gpytorch.means.ConstantMean()` is a good place to start.)
# 1. A **Kernel** - This defines the prior covariance of the GP.(If you don't know which kernel to use, a `gpytorch.kernels.ScaleKernel(gpytorch.kernels.RBFKernel())` is a good place to start).
# 1. A **MultivariateNormal** Distribution (`gpytorch.distributions.MultivariateNormal`) - This is the object used to represent multivariate normal distributions.
#   
#   
# ### The GP Model
#   
# The components of a user built (Exact, i.e. non-variational) GP model in GPyTorch are, broadly speaking:
# 
# 1. An `__init__` method that takes the training data and a likelihood, and constructs whatever objects are necessary for the model's `forward` method. This will most commonly include things like a mean module and a kernel module.
# 
# 2. A `forward` method that takes in some $n \times d$ data `x` and returns a `MultivariateNormal` with the *prior* mean and covariance evaluated at `x`. In other words, we return the vector $\mu(x)$ and the $n \times n$ matrix $K_{xx}$ representing the prior mean and covariance matrix of the GP. 
# 
# This specification leaves a large amount of flexibility when defining a model. For example, to compose two kernels via addition, you can either add the kernel modules directly:
# 
# ```python
# self.covar_module = ScaleKernel(RBFKernel() + LinearKernel())
# ```
# 
# Or you can add the outputs of the kernel in the forward method:
# 
# ```python
# covar_x = self.rbf_kernel_module(x) + self.white_noise_module(x)
# ```
# 
# 
# ### The likelihood
# 
# The simplest likelihood for regression is the `gpytorch.likelihoods.GaussianLikelihood`. This assumes a homoskedastic noise model (i.e. all inputs have the same observational noise).
# 
# There are other options for exact GP regression, such as the [FixedNoiseGaussianLikelihood](http://docs.gpytorch.ai/likelihoods.html#fixednoisegaussianlikelihood), which assigns a different observed noise value to different training inputs.

# In[4]:


# We will use the simplest form of GP model, exact inference
class ExactGPModel(gpytorch.models.ExactGP):
    def __init__(self, train_x, train_y, likelihood):
        super(ExactGPModel, self).__init__(train_x, train_y, likelihood)
        self.mean_module = gpytorch.means.ConstantMean()
        self.covar_module = gpytorch.kernels.ScaleKernel(gpytorch.kernels.RBFKernel())
    
    def forward(self, x):
        mean_x = self.mean_module(x)
        covar_x = self.covar_module(x)
        return gpytorch.distributions.MultivariateNormal(mean_x, covar_x)

# initialize likelihood and model
likelihood = gpytorch.likelihoods.GaussianLikelihood()
model = ExactGPModel(train_x, train_y, likelihood)


# ### Model modes
# 
# Like most PyTorch modules, the `ExactGP` has a `.train()` and `.eval()` mode.
# - `.train()` mode is for optimizing model hyperameters.
# - `.eval()` mode is for computing predictions through the model posterior.

# ## Training the model
# 
# In the next cell, we handle using Type-II MLE to train the hyperparameters of the Gaussian process.
# 
# The most obvious difference here compared to many other GP implementations is that, as in standard PyTorch, the core training loop is written by the user. In GPyTorch, we make use of the standard PyTorch optimizers as from `torch.optim`, and all trainable parameters of the model should be of type `torch.nn.Parameter`. Because GP models directly extend `torch.nn.Module`, calls to methods like `model.parameters()` or `model.named_parameters()` function as you might expect coming from PyTorch.
# 
# In most cases, the boilerplate code below will work well. It has the same basic components as the standard PyTorch training loop:
# 
# 1. Zero all parameter gradients
# 2. Call the model and compute the loss
# 3. Call backward on the loss to fill in gradients
# 4. Take a step on the optimizer
# 
# However, defining custom training loops allows for greater flexibility. For example, it is easy to save the parameters at each step of training, or use different learning rates for different parameters (which may be useful in deep kernel learning for example).

# In[5]:


# this is for running the notebook in our testing framework
import os
smoke_test = ('CI' in os.environ)
training_iter = 2 if smoke_test else 50


# Find optimal model hyperparameters
model.train()
likelihood.train()

# Use the adam optimizer
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)  # Includes GaussianLikelihood parameters

# "Loss" for GPs - the marginal log likelihood
mll = gpytorch.mlls.ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(likelihood, model)

for i in range(training_iter):
    # Zero gradients from previous iteration
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    # Output from model
    output = model(train_x)
    # Calc loss and backprop gradients
    loss = -mll(output, train_y)
    loss.backward()
    print('Iter %d/%d - Loss: %.3f   lengthscale: %.3f   noise: %.3f' % (
        i + 1, training_iter, loss.item(),
        model.covar_module.base_kernel.lengthscale.item(),
        model.likelihood.noise.item()
    ))
    optimizer.step()


# ## Make predictions with the model
# 
# In the next cell, we make predictions with the model. To do this, we simply put the model and likelihood in eval mode, and call both modules on the test data.
# 
# Just as a user defined GP model returns a `MultivariateNormal` containing the prior mean and covariance from forward, a trained GP model in eval mode returns a `MultivariateNormal` containing the posterior mean and covariance. Thus, getting the predictive mean and variance, and then sampling functions from the GP at the given test points could be accomplished with calls like:
# 
# ```python
# f_preds = model(test_x)
# y_preds = likelihood(model(test_x))
# 
# f_mean = f_preds.mean
# f_var = f_preds.variance
# f_covar = f_preds.covariance_matrix
# f_samples = f_preds.sample(sample_shape=torch.Size(1000,))
# ```
# 
# The `gpytorch.settings.fast_pred_var` context is not needed, but here we are giving a preview of using one of our cool features, getting faster predictive distributions using [LOVE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06058).
